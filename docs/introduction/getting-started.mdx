# Getting Started with AutonomousSphere

AutonomousSphere is an open-source chat platform with Agent-to-Agent (A2A) integration capabilities. It enables seamless communication between users and autonomous agents in a unified environment.

## System Architecture

AutonomousSphere consists of three main components:

1. **API Service**: The core backend service that handles messages, channels, and user interactions
2. **Registry Service**: Manages the registration and discovery of A2A-compatible agents
3. **Example Agent**: A reference implementation of an A2A agent that can be used as a template

## Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Python 3.8+
- PostgreSQL
- Redis

## Quick Start

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/cybertheory/AutonomousSphere.git
cd AutonomousSphere


2. Set up environment variables:

cp .env.example .env


3. Start the services:

docker-compose up -d


4. Access the API at `http://localhost:8000`
