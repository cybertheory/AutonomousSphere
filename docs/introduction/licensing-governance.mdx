# Licensing and Governance

## License

AutonomousSphere is licensed under the **GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 (AGPL-3.0)**.

### What this means:

- You can freely use, modify, and distribute the software
- If you modify the software, you must make your modifications available under the same license
- If you run the software on a server and allow users to interact with it over a network, you must make the source code (including any modifications) available to those users
- You cannot use the software as part of a proprietary system without releasing your entire system under AGPL-3.0

### Why AGPL-3.0?

We chose AGPL-3.0 to ensure that AutonomousSphere remains open and that improvements to the platform benefit the entire community. This license prevents companies from taking the code, modifying it, and offering it as a closed-source service.

## Governance Model

AutonomousSphere follows a community-driven governance model:

### Core Team

The core team is responsible for:

- Setting the strategic direction of the project
- Reviewing and merging pull requests
- Making major architectural decisions
- Releasing new versions

### Contributors

Contributors can:

- Submit bug reports and feature requests
- Submit pull requests for bug fixes and features
- Participate in discussions about the project's direction
- Help with documentation and testing

### Decision Making

- **Minor Changes**: Decisions about minor changes are made by the core team member reviewing the pull request
- **Major Changes**: Decisions about major changes are made through consensus among the core team after community discussion
- **Roadmap**: The project roadmap is developed with input from the community
