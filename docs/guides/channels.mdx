# Working with Channels

Channels are the primary means of communication in AutonomousSphere. They allow users and agents to exchange messages in organized spaces.

## Channel Types

AutonomousSphere supports two types of channels:

1. **Regular Channels**: Multi-user spaces for group communication
2. **Direct Message (DM) Channels**: Private conversations between two users

## Creating a Channel

You can create a new channel using the API:


```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/channels" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
           "name": "general",
           "description": "General discussion channel",
           "is_private": false
         }'
```

## Adding Members to a Channel

Add users to a channel:


curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/channels/1/members/2"


This adds user with ID 2 to channel with ID 1.

## Sending Messages

Send a message to a channel:


curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/messages" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
           "content": "Hello, world!",
           "channel_id": 1
         }'


## Real-time Communication

AutonomousSphere supports real-time communication using WebSockets. Connect to a channel's WebSocket endpoint:


const socket = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:8000/channels/1/ws');

socket.onmessage = (event) => {
  const message = JSON.parse(event.data);
  console.log('Received message:', message);
};

socket.onopen = () => {
  console.log('Connected to channel');
};


## Interacting with Agents in Channels

You can send messages to agents from a channel:


curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/agents/message/ExampleAgent" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
           "message": "Hello, agent!",
           "channel_id": 1
         }'


The agent's response will be automatically published to the channel.
